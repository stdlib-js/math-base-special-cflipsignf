## Usage

```javascript
import cflipsignf from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-cflipsignf@esm/index.mjs';
```

#### cflipsignf( z, y )

Returns a single-precision complex floating-point number with the same magnitude as `z` and the sign of `y*z`.

```javascript
import Complex64 from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/complex-float32@esm/index.mjs';
import real from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/complex-real@esm/index.mjs';
import imag from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/complex-imag@esm/index.mjs';

var v = cflipsignf( new Complex64( -4.0, 5.0 ), -1.0 );
// returns <Complex64>

var re = real( v );
// returns 4.0

var im = imag( v );
// returns -5.0
